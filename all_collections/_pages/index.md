# My name is Dan.

![Dan speaks at a poster presentation](/assets/images/default-teaser-500x300px.png)

I have been a public servant, an educator, an administrator, a non-profit board member, and a consultant to industry. I have touched sectors in health, oceans, technology, tourism, and faith. From art to business to social science to natural science. My education spans environmental management, human resources, data, and librarianship.
