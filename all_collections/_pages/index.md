# My name is Dan.

I am in the process of migrating from [WordPress](https://danphillips.ca) to Jekyll. This site is an alpha release.

I have been a public servant, an educator, an administrator, a non-profit board member, and a consultant to industry. I have touched sectors in health, oceans, technology, tourism, and faith. From art to business to social science to natural science. My education spans environmental management, human resources, data, and librarianship.
