**the macroblog**

![Dan and a very big fiddle][dan-fiddle]

This page is my own personal mission and vision. It is a living document, intended to change as I reflect on my goals and hone my values.

## Building Capacity of Service

The best way to serve is to ensure that those who are served are served sustainably; that they can help themselves and others going forward. It is possible to be dependable without being depended upon.

I derive great personal value through my ability to assist people in achieving their goals. (Who doesnâ€™t like to feel useful?) I also derive great personal value from helping others to feel that same satisfaction.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centres around building relationships to enable future success. I believe that people learn best when they are contributing to their own learning, and that we can encourage interaction between people who hold subject expertise. I see this as both an effective way of learning, and a path towards decolonizing academia: to create a learning environment guided by flexible frameworks instead of predefined roles and processes.
