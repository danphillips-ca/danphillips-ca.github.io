**the microblog**

![Dan looking amused][dan-ammused]

This is an example of a collection.

Here is a sample gallery. The details come from the front matter of this Collections page - so they are static.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

This is the end of the portfolio.md content. Anything below here is a list of posts. At present, I am using the `layout collection` with `entries_layout: grid`. Since I am using an external theme, I haven't yet explored the elements that build this layout. I'll do that once I get the collections link working.

In theory, posts within the collection appear below. The order could be modified in the front matter - see minimal mistakes documentation for more information.

The blog posts below contain some personal reflections, tools, and accomplishments. Please feel free to leave comments or put resources to use! I strongly believe that feedback is a critical component to reflection.
