**the microblog**

![Dan looking amused][dan-ammused]

I love to see the way people interact and communicate in different spaces, whether online or in-person. Naturally, I drift from one social media platform to the next.

Following good information management principles, I try to be mindful of use, access, and information lifecycles. When I am done with a platform, I put its privacy policies to work by deactivating and deleting inactive accounts â€” but before I do, I migrate my favourite posts here.

Privacy is about being mindful of how personal information is collected, made accessible, and put to use. Sharing the posts below helps me to brand myself, and to be a transparent and honest person.
