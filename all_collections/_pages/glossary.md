**(aka Danctionary; Danslation)**

![a bookplate that says ex libris dan phillips][dan-bookplate]

Everyone use specialized words, acronyms, abbreviations, or initialisms that aren’t widely understood. Although I try not to, I’m guilty of this too.

In late 2022, a friend asked me to provide a danctionary definition of a word I used without context. That inspired the creation of this glossary. It’s kind of like the Meaning of Liff, but with words from my own lexicon.

| Expression      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
