Who am I
I am Dan. My website is <https://danphillips.ca>.

>I am migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll. At present, I do not have a comment section on the new site. This privacy section will be updated if/when it matters.

Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site, my WordPress platform collects the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string. This helps spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Media
I don’t currently offer a means for you to upload media, but if I ever do and you upload images to this website, please should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you visit my login page, the site will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. (But there’s really no reason to visit my login page. That’s just for me to do site administration.)

If I you did log in, the site will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you were to edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

Who I share your data with
If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.

How long I retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so the platform can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on this website (if any), it also stores the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data I hold about you, including any data you have provided to me. You can also request that I erase any personal data I hold about you on this site. This does not include any data I am obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Where your data is sent
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
