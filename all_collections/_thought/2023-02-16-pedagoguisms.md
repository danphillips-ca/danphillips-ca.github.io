## Preface

In speeches and essay writing, I understand that it is a trope of bad writers to begin with a definition. I guess this makes me one of them.

> Pedagogue, a teacher or schoolmaster, a term usually now applied with a certain amount of contempt, implying pedantry dogmatism or narrow-mindedness. The Gr. *παιδαγωγός* (*παις*, boy, *ἀγωγός*, leader, *ἂγαιν*, to lead) from which the English word is derived, was not strictly an instructor. He was a slave in an Athenian household who looked after the personal safety of the sons of the master of the house, kept them from bad company, and took them to and from school and the gymnasium. He probably sat with his charges in school. The boys were put in his charge at the age of six. The being a slave, was necessarily a foreigner, usually Thracian or Asiatic.
> 
> The Romans adopted the *paedagogus* or *pedagogus* towards the end of the republic. He probably took some part in the instruction of the boys (see SCHOOLS). Under the empire, the *pedagogus* was specifically the instructor of the boy slaves who were being trained and educated in the household of the emperor and of the rich nobles and other persons; these boys lived together in a *paedagogium*, and were known as *pueri paedagogiani*, a name which has possibly developed into “page” (q.v.).

I remember elementary school teachers speaking about **lenses** and **frameworks** that they learned from their own education programs - programs that taught them how to teach. These are great ways of thinking for educators, but for me in the fifth-grade, I was too caught up in the language to focus on learning. “Lens” was easier to understand — but how can I use a “framework” if I don’t know what a framework is!

One complementary analogy that people tried to explain to me was the use of scaffolding – but I never understood how this was helpful. My interpretation is that *scaffolding* builds upon itself with the purpose of moving higher. Certainly some teaching tools build upon others, but theoretical frameworks aren’t those types of tools. (Perhaps if I understood that the intent of scaffolding for a building is to make inaccessible places accessible?) The fact that literal scaffolds are literal frameworks only serves to confuse the issue.

I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that this remained a problem for several years, well beyond undergrad. Eventually, it was a framework about literacy that made me framework-literate.

## The mental model that works for me

In my imagination, the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education exists as a hollow cube with wooden edges and a glass lens fitted for each face.

The cube in my mind has each of the six Information Literacy frame titles etched into the wood below its own window:

* Authority Is Constructed and Contextual
* Information Creation as a Process
* Information Has Value
* Research as Inquiry
* Scholarship as Conversation
* Searching as Strategic Exploration

We can place any object we want inside the cube to symbolize our literacy topic.

We can hold the cube and rotate it, looking at the object through each side one by one. It is difficult to see the object through more than one lens at a time, and fully impossible to see through all six simultaneously.

### What makes a framework different then a lens?

Let’s take this one step further. Say each of the glass lenses are tinted, and the object inside has a complicated symbols on them, not unlike that hide-and-seek book you had as a kid which came with a red magnifying glass.

If you never experienced that book, it was a bit like this:

<p class="codepen" data-height="432" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="wvxGxdR" data-user="danphillips-ca" style="height: 432px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

Each lens can be removed and replaced with a lens of a different colour. You can still look at the object from the same angle (i.e., through the same *frame*) but with a different focus (*lens*).

### Let's try an example:

Choose an object to put in our box.

In my current work, I have seen a need for non-profit board members to improve their financial literacy. The object we put in the box is similar to Plato’s idea of forms. I’ll imagine a Toonie inside the box to represent Canada’s Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Let’s use the first angle of the framework, *Authority is Constructed and Contextual*. The fitted lens on this side of the box is interchangeable. We start with our first lens. We can explore the topic of authority with questions like:

* Who is the authority that defined this object?
* Under what conditions did that authority come to be?
* Are there alternate authorities?
* How would our literacy object be different if we didn’t have an authority at all?

My Toonie is going to represent the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Through this Authority frame, we can explore many lenses and learn that this object was defined the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) and was influenced by several Canadian accounting associations. It has authoritative power because standardized methodologies are necessary to be able to compare one organization’s financial records to the next. Ergo: standards have authoritative power insofar as we want to compare one organizations financial records to another.

There are certainly other standards that could be used (and are actively used in other countries) – but the usefulness of a shared authority would be lost if all organizations within our defined scope (i.e., Canadian accountants) didn’t adhere to the same standard.

All of this is seen through one angle of our framework, and we haven’t begun to talk about the second angle: *Information Creation as a Process*.

## Are we literate yet?

Before answering the question *are we literate yet?* let’s start with semantics.

**Literacy**

> In extended use (usually with modifying word). The ability to ‘read’ a specified subject or medium; competence or knowledge in a particular area.
>
> **Oxford English Dictionary**

It depends on what we’re trying to develop competence in. For the sake of argument, let’s say we’ve put some related items in the box and rotated them as appropriate and, for whatever our purpose, let’s say that we are now literate.

Our competence looks like a pile of trivia and a list of best practices to try to remember to follow. It was a painful process, and much of what we’ve learned might not be retained. Without continuous practice, literacy might not last.

Let’s check one more definition:

**Education**

> The process of bringing up a child, with reference to forming character, shaping manners and behaviour, etc.; the manner in which a person has been brought up; an instance of this.
>
> **Oxford English Dictionary**

Admittedly, I hand-picked these definitions to help reinforce the distinction between these concepts. They may not be the most common definitions in parlance, but I have seen these concepts in Education program syllabi.

I believe it is possible to develop literacy without becoming educated. Likewise, it is possible to be educated without having literacy.

It is most ideal if we can develop both literacy and education.

## Postscript

This post began with an article published in 1910-1911 for a word which can mean “narrow-minded teacher”. It now closes on a word for “well-rounded education”.

The word encyclopaedia is derived from the Greek *enkyklios paideia*, “general education,” and it at first meant a circle or a complete system of learning — that is, an all-around education.
