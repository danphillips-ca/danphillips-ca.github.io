## What is it?

Markdown is an easy to read document formatting language that can be quickly converted to html by a plethora of tools. The essentials are pretty easy - but it's worth learning in detail if you're creating content for the web including images and hyperlinks.

Many platforms (including Github) use Extended Markdown, which handles some fancier things like tables.

## Styleguide

My personal use of markdown will have a few notes in the [Styleguide](/cheatsheets/styleguide/)

## Formatting

### Essentials

**Headings** are preceeded by a # symbol and a space character. Subheadings have the same number of the subheading tag will have in html. (i.e., `### Heading` will become `<h3>Heading</h3>`)

**Italics** are enclosed astrisks \**Like this.*\*

**Strong** tags are in double astrisks \*\***Like this.**\*\*

**Strikethrough** tags are in double tilde marks \~\~~~like this.~~\~\~

**Blockquotes** are preceeded by a "\>" character.
  > Like this.

**Special characters** (like the astrisks and tilde marks in the examples above) are preceeded by a backslash to treat them as regular characters. Common special characters like ampersands are handled by Markdown converters so I can safely ignore rules for them. (Honestly, I can't imagine how annoying it is to handle those... like it converts them for html unless they are used as html -- so `&copy;` still becomes &copy; without the need to remember it.)

Single **line breaks** are ignored for easy formatting. A single space character is added if there is none already beside the line break. Double line breaks 

Finally, a **horizontal rule** (as below) is indicated by three hyphens or three underscores. If it is not given a linebreak between, it will turn the line above it into a heading.

### Lists

* **Unordered lists** (or bullet points like this) are preceeded by a \* and a space character.
  * Sub-bullets (like this) are preceeded by two spaces. That also applies to sub-buy
  * Like this.
    * Or this.
1. **Ordered lists** begins with a number and a period.
3. Only the first number matters. (In markdown, this line is written with a "3." but it shows as a "2." because the previous line began with a "1." -- so if I might insert items later, I can go "1." all the way down the list.)


### Code

**Code** can be contained in backticks \``<div>Like this</div>`\`

**Fenced Code** works and can (in Extended Markdown) get custom markup by declaring the language after three backticks. Even when extended markdown is not available, there's no harm in including it anyway.

So this:

>  \`\`\`python
>
>  def greet():
>
>  print("hello world")    
>    
>  \`\`\`

becomes

> ``` python
> def greet():
>   print("hello world")
> ```

## Links

A link like this: <https://danphillips.ca> can be written as this `<https://danphillips.ca>`. Some implementations may recognize the hyperlink based on syntax without the pointy brackets -- but this format can work for local links too. For example, `</about/>` or somesuch.

A link that looks like this:
> [Dan Phillips](https://danphillips.ca "Dan's blog and portfolio")

is formated like this:

> `[Dan Phillips](https://danphillips.ca "Dan's blog and portfolio")`

where the square brackets contains the link text, the round brackets contains the hyperlink, and the quotes contains hovertext.

Variables can be used for the hyperlink, and a variable matching the link text will be created if none is defined. For example,

``` markdown
Visit [Dan Phillips] website.

[Dan Phillips]: https://danphillips.ca
```

will appear as,

> Visit [Dan Phillips]' website

[Dan Phillips]: https://danphillips.ca

The variable definition can appear anywhere in the document. This is handy for citations.

## Images

If positioning doesn't matter, an inline image can be declared like this:

`![Alt Text](image.png)`

shows this:

![Katherine's Dad](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8B8W93FCGZCNycjmDDzT45P80rZRIonuZik-crFRhyHJYYg5kKuTbzEyCNhfUncp4pnGJHwwzX1XFackgqZwOgpHc5qjWX4IPz2_MPCr4hCDSNhcrYl5QPoxuohkOISCSBxIpjsL1-9phSCinSS_P0gbw=w670-h893-s-no?authuser=0)

As with links, variables can be used here too. If layout or size is important, html works just as well.

---

## Tables

Tables are a pain to create, but there's a lot of tools online that can simplify this process and make them look nice in a text editor.

In short, each column must contain the same number of pipe characters (`|`) to seperate columns. The first row is for headers, and the second row must contain at least three hyphens. Whitespace after content is ignored -- which is how those generators make them look prettier.

``` markdown
|Veggie|Colour|Taste|
|---|:---:|---:|
|Potato|Brown|Delicious|
|Carrot|Orange|Delicious|
|Brocolli|Green|Yum|
```

becomes

|Veggie|Colour|Taste|
|---|:---:|---:|
|Potato|Brown|Delicious|
|Carrot|Orange|Delicious|
|Brocolli|Green|Yum|
|Tuna|Rainbow|Not-a-veggie|

Optional: Note that the `:` character in the second row determines cell alignment.


## Other things

These Extended Markup features aren't rendering properly in my test environment, so I'm leaving a note here just to remind myself that they can exist in some environments.

### Task Lists

It is possible to create task lists.

``` markdown
[ ] This is an incomplete task item.
[x] This task is done.
```

[ ] This is an incomplete task item.
[x] This task is done.

### Footnotes

Footnotes create anchors that link between both ways between the footnote link and its content. It looks like a hyperlink variable, but with a carat. (I wonder what happens when you use the same footnote twice? Probably depends on the engine parsing it.)

``` markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote from that first sentence.
```

Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote from that first sentence.

### Defined Abbreviations

Here is an example of using an abbreviation in Markdown:

```markdown
[*HTML*]: Hyper Text Markup Language

You can use HTML to create websites.

In the above example, we have defined the abbreviation "HTML" using the [*abbr*]: *definition* syntax, and then used it in the text by enclosing it in square brackets.
```
