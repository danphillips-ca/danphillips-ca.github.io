## Distilling Best Practices

As part of my research on unstructured descriptive metadata in environmental data repositories, I gave a total of five presentations with audiences of different specializations: some in research, some in cataloguing, and some in retrieval.

The video below is the version that was open for public participation. (Rest assured, my public speaking has improved since this was recorded. That first year of “everything is online” was tough!)

Many thanks to the Portage Network for Research Data Stewardship for hosting this talk as part of their 2020 Webinar series.
