# My List of Useful Open Tools

There are a lot of great directories for open software out there. The table below is my own list of Open tools that I regularly find useful in work and life.

But First: A Semantics Soapbox

I’d like differentiate between Open Access (ability to use) and Open Source (ability to see how it works). Common license practices in the Open Source community is generally that Open Source products are also Open Access, but that’s not always the case. This doesn’t begin to speak to whether derivatives products are allowed or whether the source is entirely open or just partially open… I could go on.

I include both Open Access and Open Source products in the list below because these are tools that I actively recommend to people. I think they are ethically developed and licensed regardless of the specific licensing and distribution details.

While I’m at it, I’d like to acknowledging that terms like “freeware”, “adware”, and “shareware” are not discrete categories. A few weeks ago, Ubuntu added an advertisement in the terminal – but as someone who will primarily be using the GUI, I’ll never read those ads anyway. I’ve labeled appropriately in response to my own experience.


| Title | Category | Platform | Access | Open Source | Portable Version | How I Use it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Audacity]** | Audio Production | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | Audio recording and editing. I used to volunteer with a radio room, and occasionally help people set up for their hobbyist podcast or music recording. Add-ins are easy to integrate for improved functionality, special effects, and more export options. |
| **[Calibre]** | Cataloguing | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | Cataloguing eBooks, converting filetypes, and removing digital rights management (DRM) restrictions. Some of these features require additional add-ins. |
| **[Git]** | Version Control | Windows, Mac, Linux, Browser | Freeware | Yes | Yes | I usually use Github for hosting a Jekyll website. I've also run git on a personal server for private projects. |
| **[Inkscape]** | Image Editing (Vector) | Windows | Freeware | Yes | Yes | Creating complex vinyl cuttings. |
| **[Notepad++]** | Text Editor | Windows | Freeware | Yes | Yes | Like Notepad for Windows, but better. Includes tabs and colour-coding for working with programming languages. |
| **[LibreOffice]** | Office Suite | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | Full office suite includes a word processor, spreadsheet, slideshow, database, vector-friendly drawing tool, and equations editor. |
| **[Open Broadcast Software (OBS)]** | Video Production (Live Feed) | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | An extremely powerful live video editor that can, among other things, function as a live virtual webcam. I particularly like it for controlling multiple video feeds. Consider: (1) Picture-in-picture while screen-sharing on a platform that doesn’t otherwise support it; (2) Using multiple webcams to change camera angles during a live stream; (3) Setting up a video loop for your online meeting so the boss doesn’t see you fell asleep; (4) Chromakey with video feed. |
| **[OpenShot]** | Video Production (Recorded) | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | No | A video editor. In my experience, this was less stable than ShotCut. That said, the chromakey options worked better – so I keep both on this list. |
| **[ScreenToGif]** | Video Production (Screencapture) | Windows | Freeware | Yes | No | A tool for recording sections of your screen and converting them into videos or animated gifs. Great for making tutorials and showing people how to use software. |
| **[SimpleNote]** | Text Editor | Browser | Freeware | Yes | No | A simple text editor with exactly the features I want and none of the temptation to use more. |
| **[Paint Dot Net]** | Image Editor (Raster) | Windows | Freeware | No [Not Anymore] |  | I typed out the pronunciation of this product to prevent confusion, but it’s actually called PAINT.net. Don’t let its name confuse you: the website is getpaint.net. |
| **[Photopea]** | Image Editor (Raster) | Browser | Adware [Unobtrusive] | No | No | An in-browser multi-layer raster editing tool that has proven to very reliable for quick projects. I generally prefer PAINT.net, but this is my preferred tool for frame-by-frame editing of animated gifs. |
| **[Python]** | Programming Language | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | A programming language that works particularly well for processes related to data cleaning. |
| **[Podcast Addict]** | Web Content (Podcast) | Android | Adware [Unobtrusive, Reasonable Cost] | No | No | Menu navigation is tricky at first, but the options are powerful for categorization, playback options, and automatic retention. I have contacted the developer with questions and suggestions for improvement, and he is quick to respond and implement that he agrees with. |
| **[Relay for Reddit]** | Web Content (Reddit) | Android | Adware [Unobtrusive, Reasonable Cost] | No | No | Truly the only way to use Reddit. The developer has been extremely responsive whenever I submit bug reports – and that rarely happens anymore! |
| **[ShotCut]** | Video Production (Recorded) | Windows, Mac, Linux | Freeware | Yes | Yes | This is generally my preferred video editing software, although OpenShot is still better for chromakey. |
| **[Ubuntu]** | Operating System (Linux) | N/A | Freeware | Yes | Yes | My preferred Linux distribution for personal computers. There’s lots of reasons to use it, but I’m primarily a Windows user. I keep a copy on my keychain to boot from a portable version. This is handy for troubleshooting and attempting data recovery from dead hard drives. |
| **[WordPress]** | Web Content (Blog) | Linux Server, Windows Server | Freeware | Yes | No | WordPress.org is the open source platform available for self-hosting. WordPress.com is a pre-installed iteration of that platform. Having complete control over the platform with WordPress.org on a BlueHost server helps me develop my software skills. |
