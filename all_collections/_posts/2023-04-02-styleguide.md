### Images

To keep files under the github limit, images will be hotlinked using Google Photos for hosting. Images will be stored in fully shared albums. There will be three albums:
1. **danphillips.ca-Hotlink-Images** will be used for page header images. Although none are expected, any images that are not associated with either a Journal entry or a Musing entry can also be placed here.
2. **danphillips.ca-Hotlink-Images-Content** will be used for images in journal entries.

### Markdown

I intend to always use variables for links and images, and I will define them at the end of markdown documents. This gives me a consistant place to check when migrating content to ensure that all related assets are collected.

## The brown heart ðŸ¤Ž

Brown is my favourite colour. I react with a brown heart in group chats. In my mind, brown is thematically associated with masculine objects: soil, wood, leather, coffee.

In social circles where colourful hearts are indicators of pride, I feel that I would be intruding if I used most colours beyond the plain red. My brown heart reaction is intended to express affection and support without overstepping. [Emojipedia says that the brown heart is sometimes used in topics of racial identity. Although I don't see it used that way often, I intend for its use to be supportive in that context as well.

Emojipedia also says that the brown heart is the least used of the nine coloured hearts. Let's change that.
