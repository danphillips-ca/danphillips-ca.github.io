## Purpose


### Webpage structure


### Colour palette

|Property | Description | Attribute | Muted Variation |
|---|---|---:|
|Colour|Text|#363636|#393E46|
|Secondary Colour|H1, H2, and hyperlinks|#483D8B|#7E6DC5|
|Colour|Background|#F3F3F3|None|
|Footer Colour|Background|#D6D6D6|None|

### Images

To keep files under the github limit, images will be hotlinked using Google Photos for hosting. Images will be stored in fully shared albums. There will be three albums:
1. **danphillips.ca-Hotlink-Images** will be used for page header images. Although none are expected, any images that are not associated with either a Journal entry or a Musing entry can also be placed here.
2. **danphillips.ca-Hotlink-Images-Content** will be used for images in journal entries.

## Markdown

I intend to always use variables for links and images, and I will define them at the end of markdown documents. This gives me a consistant place to check when migrating content to ensure that all related assets are collected.
