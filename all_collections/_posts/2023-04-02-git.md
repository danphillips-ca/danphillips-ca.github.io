Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track changes to their codebase and collaborate with others. Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands:

## Basic commands

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git add <file>`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `git add .`: Add all changed files to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: View the status of your working directory.

## Branching and merging

- `git branch`: List all local branches.
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge changes from another branch into the current branch.
- `git merge --abort`: Abort a merge that has conflicts.

## Remotes

- `git remote add <name> <url>`: Add a remote repository.
- `git fetch <remote>`: Fetch changes from a remote repository.
- `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Pull changes from a remote branch.
- `git push <remote> <branch>`: Push changes to a remote branch.
- `git push --force <remote> <branch>`: Force push changes to a remote branch.

## Reverting and resetting

- `git revert <commit>`: Revert a commit by creating a new commit.
- `git reset <commit>`: Reset the current branch to a previous commit.
- `git reset --hard <commit>`: Reset the current branch to a previous commit and discard all changes.

## Other useful commands

- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git diff`: Show the difference between the working directory and the last commit.
- `git tag <tag-name>`: Create a new tag for the current commit.
- `git stash`: Stash changes in the working directory for later use.
- `git clean`: Remove untracked files from the working directory.

### Common Flags

Here are some common flags you can use with the above commands:

- `-m "<message>"`: Use this flag with `git commit` to provide a descriptive commit message. For example: `git commit -m "Added new feature"`
- `-f`: Use this flag with `git clean` to force removal of untracked files and directories. For example: `git clean -f`
- `-d`: Use this flag with `git clean` to remove untracked directories. For example: `git clean -f -d`
- `-x`: Use this flag with `git clean` to remove ignored files and directories in addition to untracked files and directories. For example: `git clean -f -d -x`
- `--force`: Use this flag with `git push` to force push changes to a remote branch. For example: `git push --force origin master`
