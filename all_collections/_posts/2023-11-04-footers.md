A footer is not a substitute for website navigation.

Throughout the 2010s, many platforms and organizations were moving towards a simplified layout. I remember watching the Laurier web renewal project which has remained largely unchanged in the screenshot below.

It includes a logo, five links, six social media platform icons, a copyright statement, and a list of campus locations.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ADCreHfxhRnon2mMShnhUGMAIECnBlH9Ak3gVKi9SDwVC_NBS3SIlBjGRVHYa7CoFVgucYBAWRFcp_15nFoYu1dy3scHMePHtvxxkZ5ulU1rswFn5FgXLPB0lWY4Ml4ACHGyynXnaVAKO3-10vPc4LPgSYxDEg=w1901-h486-s-no-gm?authuser=0)

Recently, I've noticed that organizations are opting for several different layers of footers. I think this is largely because of the way that websites represent the entirety of large organizations: the lower in the footer that information is presented, the broader its importance.

**Contact Information -- department level**
* Address/Hours
* Email addresses and phone numbers
* Social media

**Communication Channels - business unit level**
* Newsletter signup
* Feedback forms
* RSS feeds
* Job postings

**Policies -- applicable to entire organizations**
* Strategy/Mission/Vision
* Terms of Service
* Privacy
* Commitments
* Brand guidelines

**Identifiers -- organizational governance from beyond the organization**
* Charitable registration numbers
* Business licenses

**Credits -- hardly even about the organization at all anymore**
* Information about the platform and/or webmaster
* Copyright statement
* Update datestamp

Libraries tend to be flatter organizations,
