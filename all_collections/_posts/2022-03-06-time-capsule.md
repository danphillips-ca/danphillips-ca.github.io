## Background/Inspiration

If you live somewhere that observes daylight saving time, youâ€™ll be familiar with the term **Spring Ahead**. Thatâ€™s the time when we set the clocks forward one hour in March. The hour never happens, so that day is only ***23 hours*** long. Itâ€™s like weâ€™ve put that hour in a box to save for later. This is when Daylight Saving Time begins.

Six months later, we **Fall Back**. Thatâ€™s when we set our clocks back an hour. Functionally, that hour happens twice and our day is ***25 hours long***. Itâ€™s like weâ€™ve taken our Spring hour back out of the box.

*What else can we put in a box for six months?*

## Learning Objectives
When you feel like youâ€™re in a rut, it can be valuable to remember that things do change over time. Sometimes change feels like progress, and other times it feels difficult. In either case, this lesson provides an opportunity to reflect on change in their lives. At the end of this activity, participants may:

* develop perspective on how changes occur over time;
* understand the value of setting making plans, breaking down tasks, and setting incremental goals;
* appreciate that resources available today may not be available tomorrow.

## Audience
This is an activity for all ages and walks of life. Undoubtedly, different people will get different things out of this exercise. This activity can be done individually or as part of a group.

Personally, I like the idea of doing this in a way that reflects parallel play: participants do this activity independently among peers who are also doing their activity independently.

## Resources Required

This activity should be started one to two weeks before Daylight Saving Time begins.

A container small enough to be stored for a long period of time without trouble. Shoeboxes work really well.
Optional: A camera. Film cameras work really well.

## Activity

In the week leading up to Daylight Saving Time, participants are asked to place no more than six mementos of their current lives into their box. They should be mindful to include things that are part of their normal day-to-day activities, as well as a few items that they expect will signify change.

If participants are using cameras, they are asked to take several photos of day-to-day life. Do not develop the results. Instead, include the storage medium (roll of film or memory card) as one of the mementos.

In November, the end of Daylight Saving Time signifies the time to open the Time Capsule and develop the film.

## Reflection
Participants are asked to reflect on their mementos.

### Sample questions they might consider:

1. What items did you include in the box?
2. Why did you originally select those items?
3. What does each item make you think of today?
4. Is this different than you expected?

>## Example
>
>My box this year contained:
>
>* A **whale-shaped plant pot**, gifted to me by a colleague at DeepSense. (I left DeepSense to begin a new job with the Municipality shortly before creating the Time Capsule.)
>* A small **stuffed animal**, given to me by a close friend who I knew would be moving abroad shortly after the Time Capsule was sealed.
>* **Papers from a conference** I had attended several months ago that I wanted to read, but knew I wouldnâ€™t have time for a while.
>* A **roll of film**.
>* And, of course, I got back the ***hour that was lost in the spring***. ðŸ˜‰
>
>The *whale-shaped plant pot* and *stuffed animal* were expectedly sentimental. While symbolic of things that I knew I would be losing, these items gave me a chance to reflect on the experience Iâ€™ve had meeting new people since then; how scary it can be to join an established workplace where everyone knows each other already, and how it becomes more comfortable in just a few short weeks.
>
>The *papers from a conference* seemed so important when I put them in the box. In the end, I wasnâ€™t interested in reading them after all. Itâ€™s interesting to see how priorities can change, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that!
>
>The *roll of film* was very fun. Film is always nostalgic to someone my age, even if it was snapped six months ago. I grew up in the days of dropping rolls of film off at the back of the grocery store, and flipping through photos in the back of my parentâ€™s crawl space.
>
>Once I got it developed, I found that the roll included many photos that I forgot:
>
>Scenes from my commute, which was new to me at the time. (I still take the same public transit, but I have my nose in a book and havenâ€™t noticed the view out the window in a while.)
>* The view from my office. (Due to building renovations, I wasnâ€™t in that office very long â€“ so itâ€™s neat to see now!)
>* My back yard. (Itâ€™s fall now, and the leaves have fallen off the trees. In these photos, they are barely beginning to bud!)
>* Friends who donâ€™t look the same. (I forgot that guy had a moustache!)
>
>Back in March, I remember thinking that I wasted a roll of film on these mundane images. Now in November, those day-to-day scenes are fascinating to revisit.
>
>Oh, and with the *hour I got back from the spring*? I spent most of it going through the box, and finished it by reading a chapter of my book.

## Risk

The example above is a very positive experience. In that same period of time, participants may find that their life is more difficult than it was a short time ago. Mementos may remind participants of a time before a trauma occurred.
