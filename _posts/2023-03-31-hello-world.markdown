This is my first post to use as a template for migrating my blog from [WordPress][WordPress-link] on Bluehost to [Jekyll][Jekyll-link] on GitHub Pages. The links in this paragraph largely exist to remind myself how to make them in this markdarkdown iteration.

At present, the theme is "minimal-mistakes-jekyll" which I was only able to get working with GitHubs Pages by using a remote theme addon. The direct theme works well locally -- so if I ever need to migrate and build elsewhere, it should be easy enough.

Here's some of the guidance in the default blog post that I might find handy later:

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
